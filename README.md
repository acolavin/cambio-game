cambio-server is Flask-SocketIO back-end service, which takes care of game logic. Create a python environment based on the environment.yaml, and you should be able to do `python -m cambio-server.app`

cambio-client is a React.js front-end rendering and interface. To run the front-end service, you'll need `npm` and `node`. Once installed, you can run `python -m cambio-server.app` in that directory.

Better instructions for installing and contributing forthcoming!
